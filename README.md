# Data Science Bootcamp Exercises - Alura Latam

Welcome to the repository for the exercises and projects from the **Data Science Bootcamp** by **Alura Latam and Oracle**. This repository contains my progress, notes, and solutions to the challenges provided during the specialization bootcamp.

## About the Bootcamp

The Data Science Bootcamp from Alura Latam focuses on building foundational skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Participants gain hands-on experience with key tools and techniques used in the field, including Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, among others.
More information in [bootcamp](https://www.oracle.com/co/education/oracle-next-education/) site.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks containing exercises, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights derived from datasets.
- **`datasets/`**: Datasets used throughout the bootcamp, either provided by Alura or sourced from public repositories.
- **`exercises/`**: Solutions to the bootcamp proposed exercises.
- **`projects/`**: Larger projects that integrate multiple concepts covered during the bootcamp.
- **`resources/`**: Additional learning materials, notes, and references including own made notes.

## Tools & Technologies

The projects/files in this repository utilizes the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for all exercises.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive coding and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and preprocessing tools.
- **Google Colab**: For running notebooks in the cloud.
